        <h2>General information</h2>
        <h3>What is Hour of Code?</h3>
        <p>The Hour of Code is a worldwide movement that aims to introduce millions of students to computer science through one-hour coding activities. Through Hour of Code, we aim to demystify coding and show that anyone can learn the basics, inspiring future interest in computer science.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Event Summary</h2>
        <div class="eventSummary"><p>On November 5th 2024, Team 41 had a session teaching 20 students of 7A about fundamentals of coding. 
            Firstly, every member of our got acquainted with the instructions and discussed their opinions about communities.
             We decided to choose Secondary School #171 named after Zaur Məmmədov, where Nihan graduated from.
              This session was beneficial for children because they were learning basic programming with Python, not learning the algorithms.
               As Professor Donald Knuth said, we should focus on “explain to human beings what we want a computer to do” rather than “instructing a computer what to do”. 
               This is why during our Hour of Code we thoroughly mentioned the importance of basic characterics of algorithms,
                such as its effectiveness with relation to the code being as simple as possible. 
                We also decided to choose 7th graders as our community so that they could acquire some basic knowledge and skills about programming and algorithms (with visualizations) before covering introduction to programming in school. 
                On event day, Nihan went to school earlier to check whether computers in the scheduled room were working well or not. Ikram and Nihan opened the presentation about ADA University. Then Seljan and Banu came to school, and all team members prepared the room for the event.

        <h3>Progression through the course</h3>

        <p>
            From the start, students showed a high level of interest and excitement about learning coding. 
            After Ikram’s presentation about ADA University sparked their curiosity, as several students expressed familiarity with the university’s reputation. 
            This helped to create a connection between their current learning (they were covering Word in their informatics class, which was observed in the previous classes) and future academic possibilities. When Nihan introduced Code.org, 
            the students responded with enthusiasm, eagerly following along on their computers as she explained the basic steps of solving coding puzzles. 
            Some of the students tried to solve maze puzzles without our help. This indicates that they have potential to learn more complicated algorithms.
            <br>
            In terms of progress, the students adapted to the introductory puzzles quite well. Initially, we observed most students could follow the steps independently. The main struggles were observed starting from loop problems. To encourage active participation, we invited volunteers to demonstrate the steps in front of their peers, fostering confidence and public speaking skills. One volunteer, although struggling initially, successfully completed the task with our help. In turn, it inspired other students to be more active without the fear of failure. Observing these moments of individual and group achievement was particularly rewarding, as it underscored the value of practical exercises in building understanding and confidence.
